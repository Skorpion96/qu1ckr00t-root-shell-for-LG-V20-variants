# qu1ckr00t-root-shell-for-LG-V20-variants
Files for achieving full root on LG V20 with 2019 patch
First a disclaimer, the original exploit and the port are of the respective owners, which are, for the exploit:https://github.com/grant-h/qu1ckr00t/commits?author=grant-h
for the port to LG V20 is:https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/arpruss.2714177/
the code of the pc part is from dirtysanta exploit for LG V20, i just tried to replace it with qu1ckr00t:https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/ls997-vs995-h910-f800l-dirtysanta-bootloader-unlock-and-root-guide.3519410/ with his respective owner
remember i only edited other people code, i own nothing, i just wanted to make life of others easier, i hope you will apprecciate
I don't have an LG V20 so i can't try if the stuff works, i personally believe the qu1ckr00t edited app works, i don't know about mtk easy su one, same for the pc part of the exploit, but at least people can have a temp root
dont forget to extract tar.xz as i compressed because github limit is 25 MB
